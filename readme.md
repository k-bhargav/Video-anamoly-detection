### To Run

To run this file, install all the required dependencies in the local system which are Numpy, Matplotlib, Tensorflow, cv2 and required dependenices.

Now, download any video you want to test this on and name is "test.mp4" in the same directory this code resides in.

Now, create a folder named "frames" and another folder called "test_output" and run the code.

### Problem Statement

Here, we tend to build a Smart CCTV surveillance system which would store only the interesting parts of the entire footage thus making it easier to detect anamolies cutting down hours of footage to bare minutes if required.

### Input and Output

We give any "test.mp4" as the input and it would break it into individual frames. An example can be seen in the "frames" folder which has 926 frames. Upon processing, it would populate the "test_output" folder. We can see it only has 612 frames discarding the useless frames. It also detects the objects in the video.
